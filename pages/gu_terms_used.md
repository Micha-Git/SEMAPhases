#### Guideline for the Analysis Artifact "Terms Used"

- Terms are sorted in alphabetical order.
- Terms which include abbreviations are written out. The abbreviation follows the term in a new line in brackets.
- The definition of the terms start with one of the following categories:

| Category           | Explanation                                                  |
