#### Guideline for the Analysis Artifact "Terms Used"

- Terms which include abbreviations are written out. The abbreviation follows the term in a new line in brackets.
- Terms are used consistently throughout the engineering phases and artifacts.
- The definition of the terms start with one of the following categories:

| Unit               | A unit can be physical, virtual or implementation            |
